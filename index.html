                                        I arrived at an outdoor private Chilean party next to the beach at sunset time.
                                        I'm
                                        not
                                        from Chile but
                                        all the
                                        travelers in this particular town were from that country. I won my invitation
                                        performing
                                        one of the
                                        bravest
                                        acts an adult person can carry out in this century: the act of asking for help.
                                        I was new in the community, trying to put myself out there, so I did what all
                                        the
                                        travelers do when they
                                        just
                                        arrive. I posted a message on social media.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “Hey beautiful people.”

                                        Like it or not, on social media, we need to sound cool and compliment others if
                                        we
                                        are
                                        pursuing positive
                                        feedback,
                                        even
                                        though you have never seen their faces or deal with their personalities.

                                        freely showing off their bodies, changing the parameters of beauty and
                                        intelligence,

                                        Nah, I didn’t write that, however that was the hidden meaning behind it. I
                                        played
                                        chill
                                        and someone
                                        commented back!

                                        I think she was more scared than me.

                                    <p>
                                        I won’t say much about her yet, that’s another break up story for another time
                                        when
                                        I
                                        can sit down,
                                        replay
                                        it and
                                        write
                                        about how another female friend borrowed some of my time, my laughs, my heart
                                        and
                                        gave
                                        it all back when
                                        she
                                        no
                                        longer
                                        needed it and surprisingly, I went along with it, without throwing a tantrum.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        She invited me to the party I mentioned earlier. I assisted, since I would never
                                        miss a
                                        party.

                                        I arrived, it was really dark, loads of people standing, chatting, eating and
                                        drinking.
                                        Everyone was
                                        brownish and
                                        petite, like me! So I blended in. But he, he absolutely didn’t.

                                        Taller than the rest, bright fluorescent blonde hair, fresh face with a curious
                                        look
                                        on
                                        his eyes and a
                                        troublemaker
                                        aspect that you know, you all know what I mean, someone so exceedingly fucking
                                        attractive that you could
                                        only dream
                                        about, that without a doubt, any moment you´ll expend along his side it’s going
                                        to
                                        be so
                                        good and
                                        extreme
                                        that it’ll
                                        take you down.

                                        I’m at a certain age and time where I consider myself a more mature person, an
                                        older
                                        woman with more
                                        wisdom
                                        in terms
                                        of
                                        human connections, I would say nearly becoming a Jedi of letting things and
                                        people
                                        go,
                                        easier than
                                        before.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But, BUT, when I saw this person, because I’m able to read my own signs, I
                                        immediately
                                        understood how
                                        badly
                                        I will
                                        lose
                                        my shit for him.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        So I did, I lost it. I was long gone, swimming in his blue ocean fucker eyes.

                                        That should be a color, the color which identifies crazy, exceptional, bad
                                        shitty
                                        things, so as soon as
                                        you
                                        visualise
                                        it, you stop and slowly, silently, turn around and drive away.

                                        I saw it, went around it and parked right on top of him. To be more accurate,
                                        when
                                        he
                                        told me what he
                                        told
                                        me, I was
                                        precisely under him.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Music was playing, everyone was screaming, in Spanish.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My mother tongue is Spanish too, but given that I was a newbie, I was still
                                        speaking
                                        quietly, not yet
                                        screaming.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        At that moment, this amazing good looking creature was looking at everyone, he
                                        was
                                        seated less than four
                                        feet away
                                        from
                                        me, not understanding a word, probably about to leave. Due to this, I opened a
                                        twelve
                                        ounce bottle of
                                        courage and
                                        decided to speak to him.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I leaned in with my body towards him, releasing the screamer inside me:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “WHERE__ARE YOU FROM?.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        He turned his neck in my direction, looking right at me, literally, his neck
                                        moved
                                        so
                                        fast and perfectly
                                        aimed my
                                        face
                                        as if he was a killer robot aiming at his next victim.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        THE CREATURE replies:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “I can’t hear you.”- He said and instantly looked away.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        All my twenty nine year old woman’s confidence went away like a breeze. Nah, it
                                        went
                                        away more like when
                                        you're shit
                                        faced, vomiting and your puke leaves your body while also, taking your soul and
                                        leaving
                                        your corpse dead
                                        on
                                        a
                                        bathroom
                                        floor.

                                        Despite the rejection I had just experienced, in my mind, I could only hear one
                                        thought:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “ Oh, I love him”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        What just happened here was a perfect "DO NOT ENTER, DANGER" prompt.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My mind incorrectly translated: “I love him.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        My stubborn mind : “I loved him more than 1.5 seconds ago.”

                                        Signals kept hitting my forehead:

                                        Later that night I was walking on a colossal hill, making my way home, barely
                                        breathing,
                                        not because I
                                        was
                                        running
                                        or
                                        someone was chasing me, it was just that I wasn’t in shape for that big
                                        motherfucker
                                        hill. When,
                                        somehow,
                                        the lack
                                        of
                                        oxygen affected me so I texted him.

                                        I went into the building, took the stairs to the third floor, entered the house
                                        and
                                        finally took my
                                        pants
                                        off.

                                        The bright light of the screen, illuminated the tremendous terrifying smile on
                                        my
                                        face.
                                        Within a second
                                        I
                                        put on

                                        clean panties and I rolled down that steep amazing hill.

                                        Imagine, I went down as fast as you can go when you go downwards in a roller
                                        coaster.

                                        You see, different perspectives aren’t that bad!. Now the hill has become my
                                        ally.

                                        Well, we did it outdoors, indoors, standing, falling, laying down, on the sand,
                                        in
                                        the
                                        car, pretty much
                                        from
                                        all the
                                        angles that we found it possible.

                                        But the last time we did it, that night, I was laying down on his bed, under
                                        him,
                                        with
                                        my legs holding
                                        his
                                        body,
                                        crossed
                                        around his waist, he was staring at me, looking awkwardly directly into my eyes,
                                        penetrating my vision
                                        with
                                        those
                                        two
                                        blue eyes. I promise you, I could see whales and dolphins swimming in there.

                                        He was touching my brown hair, my brown eyebrows with genuine curiosity, almost
                                        like
                                        he
                                        has never seen
                                        brown

                                        Anyhow, as I was describing before, my legs were up crossed around his waist.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        He was moving in and out, in and out, in and in and IN.

                                    <p>
                                        My eyes started opening widely.

                                    <p>
                                        I began to wander, where is he trying to go? What is he trying to reach?.

                                    <p>
                                        At some level I started being curious myself, thinking, oh!, maybe he found a
                                        secret
                                        door and is trying
                                        to
                                        open it.

                                        Is that where the lost and found main office is?.

                                        During all this situation he never glanced once, he kept looking straight at me,
                                        I
                                        could
                                        feel the water
                                        splashing on
                                        my

                                        Finally he says:

                                    <p>
                                        “I can get you pregnant”— I know this is the way — have seen it on YouTube's
                                        videos.”

                                        I couldn’t get pregnant because we were using protection, but by some means, he
                                        was
                                        curious about the
                                        video
                                        he
                                        watched
                                        on YouTube and felt like experimenting on me.

                                        This explanation took him twenty seven minutes, he was on and on about how this

                                        the

                                        I would love to end the story saying that I learnt not to date younger guys, but
                                        I
                                        would

                                        after sex.

                                        annoying, the travelers on the bus that won’t shut up. We haven’t been doing
                                        anything
                                        with our day so we sound like irresponsible teenagers, which we are not, but we
                                        are
                                        still fresh, juicy enough.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Once more, we jumped out of the bus to take another. When I say jump, it's
                                        because
                                        we
                                        were actually jumping from one place to another in the city of fury, then
                                        running
                                        again,
                                        stopping, buying liquor, back to running and jumping while drinking the liquor.
                                        The
                                        heat
                                        of the summer had got into us, as also, our last months of freedom. We had a
                                        sense
                                        that
                                        our time as young people under the view of the more professionally established
                                        adults,
                                        was about to run out.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We were standing on a long line, outside of a gay club. I could hear loud
                                        laughs,
                                        louder
                                        compliments and good vibes all the way from the start to the end.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Her tiny hands were being specially warm with me. Somehow she wanted me to
                                        notice
                                        that
                                        tonight she was there.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We have always been there for each other, it isn’t a large group though, but
                                        every
                                        single one of us counts.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We were inside the club, high ceiling above us, a theater about to collapse it
                                        was
                                        the
                                        aspect of the building. I rushed to take the European stairs all the way up, to
                                        look
                                        all
                                        the way down, to captured a mental picture of my friends perfectly framed by the
                                        round
                                        shape, intentionally planned and built by some architect.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “Come down!” She yelled.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A set of steps later, we were dancing, jumping and sweating again.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        An international Queer band started playing. We went wild, as so they did.An
                                        atmosphere
                                        of sensuality was surrounding me. Red, blue, violet led lights reflected on
                                        ripped
                                        bodies, many outlined eyes mutually penetrating each other in every single
                                        direction.
                                        Everyone seducing anyone just to fulfill the desire of experimenting and the
                                        idea
                                        that
                                        tonight was all we had. Make it count, feel alive, taste mystery, taste anyone,
                                        taste
                                        me!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I joined the game of seduction, there was no one there who actually desired me,
                                        we
                                        all
                                        enjoyed playing it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        She was getting closer and closer, touching my waist, grabbing it, pirouetting
                                        around
                                        me, still playing shy with the eyes, but burning me with the body.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        WAIT!.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Is someone desiring me?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Are we still part of the game? Because this is starting to feel real,
                                        consequently
                                        confusing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I felt her lips on my ear, we were bouncing up and down, I kept dancing while
                                        she
                                        was
                                        talking to me. The loud music and the level of alcohol was affecting the
                                        conversation. I
                                        hardly understood what she was saying.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Stop!.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I wasn't understanding a word, although I wanted to keep dancing so I laughed,
                                        faking
                                        it, she hugged me, mistakenly kissed me on the neck, when aiming for the cheek.
                                        Her
                                        lips
                                        were back on my ear, I listened:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “You know.”- she said affirming.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After saying this, she pressed her body against mine.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I was very confused, my mind was processing this experience slower than my body.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “Do I like her touching me? whispering on my ear? What is she assuming that I
                                        know
                                        that
                                        I don´t know?.” -I asked myself.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My mind kept rumbling: she is drunk as fuck. Why am I not totally disliking
                                        this?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My body: she isn't that drunk, she wants you to know.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My other friend's eyes staring at me: “What is happening?. What is she saying to
                                        you?
                                        Why are you two so close?.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My mind playing safe: “I have no idea. She is doing it, don’t judge me. It's
                                        summer.
                                        We
                                        do crazy things in summer.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My body: “Don’t stop. Give me more signs so I can put all the pieces together.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        An observation: This wasn’t the first time I've been in this situation with her
                                        during
                                        this summer.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Mate, I love summers, especially, Argentinian summers. You never know what to
                                        expect,
                                        everyone is keen on anything. Freedom is on the air, we react differently to the
                                        same
                                        situations we confront in other seasons, lifting the barriers and letting in
                                        more.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Picture me now, dancing loosen, allowing random people to touch me.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “ Let’s go dance somewhere else.”- She said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        She pulled me by the shirt, we go through the mass, only the two of us dancing
                                        in
                                        the
                                        middle of strangers.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I was amazed, admiring them, they were so glamorous. The way they kissed without
                                        caring
                                        who was looking, the way they moved, the colorful shiny makeup on their faces,
                                        as
                                        well
                                        spread from the top of their chest to the lower part of the abdomen and beyond.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I closed my eyes, allowing my body to be guided by the music.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Listen to the beat of music:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        ♫♫♪♫♪♫♪♫♪...
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As I opened them, a girl was furiously kissing her.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I could tell this wasn´t their first kiss.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Then, I knew.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My dearest friend has a girlfriend, another girl she has been kissing and
                                        falling in
                                        love with.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        She kissed her instead of me, letting me, standing alone at the altar of
                                        experimental
                                        love.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For some time that night I felt so captivated.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “Did you? or was it something else catching your attention?.”- Someone else
                                        said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Adrenaline, my favourite substance, followed by mystery and to spice it up,
                                        something
                                        prohibited to me only by my mind, the perfect combination to make me bite.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It was bright when we came out of the club, an abstract flag was the color of
                                        the
                                        sky, a
                                        few cars were passing by, their lights were like stars to my dizzy eyes. I could
                                        smell
                                        the uncontaminated air of sunset.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I walked her home, she leaned on my shoulder, falling asleep between steps.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I left her right outside of her door, she fell to the ground, I smiled and
                                        walked
                                        back
                                        to pick her up.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I went on my knees, lifted her face up:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “ Hey, I’m here. I know and I'm staying right here.”- My whole me said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        She exhaled profoundly, as if she was feeling relieved, taking only a small
                                        percentage
                                        of pressure from her shoulders, as I imagined telling me it was miles easier
                                        than
                                        having
                                        to tell her family. She smiled, time was suspended for a few seconds, then
                                        inevitably,
                                        her face went down, smashing the ground.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        SHIT! My bad. I thought I had her, but well, I guess we were both equally drunk.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I took her upstairs, tucked her in and laid down next to her. We fell asleep.
                                    </p>

                                        In a small Mexican town, a treasure finder arrived.

                                    <p>
                                        He was looking for the roots of the Wild yam that native women

                                    <p>
                                        have been consuming as contraception and he found it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Men from all over the world had heard the story.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        They had listened to the whispers many times.

                                    <p>
                                        They still are debatable on where to get it, the amount of formalities we need
                                        to go
                                        through and the many side effects this tiny little gems causes to the female
                                        body.

                                        But they fancy it anyway.

                                        They want women to take it, to experienced an abnormal sensation of pleasure or

                                        least, that's what they say.

                                        Number one:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I'm in a kitchen, wearing only warm winter socks and a male's worn out shirt, no
                                        bra
                                        under, mixing a few ingredients to make a chocolate mousse after smoking a
                                        joint.
                                        The light enters through the window bars, snow covers the land of the farm. He
                                        is
                                        behind me, admiring what he can see of my body and imagining the rest. I can
                                        sense
                                        he is hungry, he would come to me soon.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        He does. He holds my breast, presses them, kisses me from the neck hasta el
                                        coño.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Although I'm very into this situation, yet, I keep thinking I must whip the
                                        mousse
                                        until thick to make the ultimate dessert.

                                        When he can't contain it anymore, he pull down his pants and asks:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “Are you on the pill?.”

                                        My feet are submerged in warm crystal water, I move them around nervously, while
                                        staring at them, avoiding eye contact with him, but slightly smiling, wishing he
                                        is
                                        captivated by my red big lips.

                                        It's late, I have to work tomorrow but I'm curious to find out what would happen
                                        if
                                        I stay longer.

                                    <p>
                                        I take my wet legs out of the pool and only responsible words come out of my

                                        I enter his apartment, with the truthful excuse of picking up my bag, he
                                        follows.
                                        With all my belongings on my hands, I intended to kiss him goodbye on his cheek,
                                        a
                                        trick that I'm grateful to my culture for.

                                    <p>
                                        From there, we ended up on his couch, on his bed, against the walls, still fully
                                        dressed.
                                    </p>

                                        We're attached, can't have enough of this addictive kiss.

                                        While I'm still all over his face, I realised the clock isn't going any slower.

                                        don't have a hair brush, I’m positive he doesn't own one. Could I use my fingers
                                        to
                                        detangle my hair?. Good news is, I have my toothbrush, I wouldn't get out of the

                                        Close enough. I'll deal with that in the morning.

                                        We continue with the kissing, touching, undressing.

                                        Question two: “Are you on the pill?.” - he asked.

                                        Sun rays on their faces, carefully, she walks behind him, keeping her distance,
                                        analyzing why she is out in the wild with a traveler she just met the night
                                        before.

                                        a
                                        gorgeous, Danish guy is leading the way on a risky path. Between sweats,
                                        stumbles
                                        and mud,she enjoys the best view of the show he is performing.

                                        Sometimes he comes back to help her, offering his hand when the hiking gets
                                        trickier
                                        and a good deal of thoughts keep crossing her mind:

                                        He walks towards her, without saying any danish words and intensively kisses
                                        her.

                                        I was having a makeover, preparing for the most awaited event, of a monster’s
                                        calendar, after a year of living life as a single woman, erasing the scars
                                        Victor
                                        left on me, when a wise, and I would say occasionally, a bit evil hairdresser,
                                        shared with me a secret tool that was useful to get her through life in one
                                        piece.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Since my creator was no longer in the picture to fix me up with new pieces, I
                                        listened.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Whilst she was sticking metal in my skull, spraying it with toxic chemicals,
                                        trying
                                        to build an indestructible tower of hair, similar to Marie Antoinette’s
                                        hairstyle
                                        but missing the extravagant feathers , she advised me to stop distracting myself
                                        with the wrong boy, to find a man who will financially support me, the one that
                                        will
                                        be there for me, more as a friend than a wild lover, someone nice, even if
                                        boredom
                                        was guaranteed. The rest, which I assumed she was referring to passionate love,
                                        doesn't matter anymore, you had that when you were a teenager, an innocent child
                                        refusing to put on a bullet proof vest, leaving the heart widely exposed to the
                                        evil
                                        of the world.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “So honey, remember the lovers of your youth with kindness and nostalgia, but
                                        understand from now on, your mind must focus on surviving in the practical
                                        world.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It took me five years to appreciate what she meant without feeling horrified by
                                        the
                                        idea and judgmental about her way of thinking.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “AWWW FUCK!, that hurts like a cheater.”- I screamed, but she ruthlessly kept
                                        burying metal in my hair.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “Sorry love, suffer now and you´ll look astonishing later. Now—the final touch,
                                        the
                                        white lightning—hand me the paint.”- The hairdresser said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This is how my Halloween night started in New York City, complaining while my
                                        host,
                                        also a professional hairdresser, tied heaps of knots in my hair to bring off the
                                        appearance of Lily Frankenstein.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Later, I found myself being part of one of the biggest parades of the continent,
                                        among Michael Jackson and his zombie dancers, along with Chewbacca, some
                                        superheroines, more zombies from a bunch of other movies, and a killer clown.
                                        Wait,
                                        maybe the killer clown was also Michael?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Anyhow, I was adjusting to the euphoria of the audience cheering us from the
                                        far,
                                        while meticulously, also absurdly, looking for my relatives, who were visiting
                                        from
                                        the south, in the middle of a massive disguised crowd.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In the absence of the Dutch Courage sweet poison, I was consciously walking for
                                        kilometers, while I couldn't stop myself from thinking how unusual this was.
                                        Alcohol
                                        prohibited on a party parade in one of the drunkest countries I've ever been?.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I must confess, since I moved here, I was buying a six pack twice a week,
                                        drinking
                                        with a girlfriend on a boat in a residential lake, living in an american TV show
                                        set
                                        from seven to sixish, as a housewife of Connecticut, borrowing the mansion in
                                        the
                                        woods, the BMW, the kids, the wife and thankfully, no having to worry much about
                                        the
                                        husband. I was a full time, extra time, Au Pair.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Finally, I reached the end line of this scary parade, just in time when my phone
                                        started ringing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        My godfather and his smart doctor girlfriend had found free WiFi and they had
                                        managed to call me.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I believed it was the first time we met as adults, drunk beer together and
                                        danced
                                        the night, which for them the length of the night lasts only two hours.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Midway through their night, he started crying.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It’s clear that now, we have been drinking the sweet poison, perhaps it was not
                                        allowed before, because it was being reserved for the moment of your life when
                                        you
                                        really need it. I incredulously thought this was that moment for me during this
                                        night.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        He apologized, or in his mind, the speech he gave me sounded similar to an
                                        apology.
                                    </p>

                                        Wait, this is a relevant piece of information. Damas Gratis is an Argentine
                                        cumbia

                                        Back to the scary speech:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “Goddaughter, I'm sorry for no being there for you when you were a child, I was
                                        dealing with my own problems, studying medicine while working, raising two kids,
                                        going through divorce, fighting for the love of this one.”- he winked at his
                                        girlfriend and continued.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “I feel, — now it's the best time to have this conversation, because...”

                                    <p>
                                        “I strongly disagree with that.”

                                        “You are a grown up, capable of understanding that we cannot be everywhere or be
                                        present for everyone at all times, our own lives are shitty enough. So forgive
                                        me
                                        for no being there, but you aren't in a position to judge, think where you were,
                                        when your sister was decorating the salon party, standing alone on a ladder,
                                        without
                                        anyone holding it from the bottom, on your goddaughter’s birthday party.”

                                    <p>
                                        You see why I wasn’t convinced about this being an apology.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In an act of solidarity, his girlfriend took me to the bathroom, we chatted for
                                        a
                                        few minutes, then she held my hand, left two pills of ecstasy in my palm and
                                        said:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “We already took ours, we should go home to be safe when it kicks.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I took the train back to Connecticut although there was one more place where I
                                        intended to be that night.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Before arriving at the station , I looked at my reflection on the window, my
                                        face
                                        was covered by a thin layer of white gray paint, my lips colored with dark
                                        violet
                                        lipstick, I was wearing a short black lace dress with a violet classical
                                        ballerina
                                        tutu under. The hair tower was intact. I could see how this outfit wasn't my
                                        sexiest, but certainly the most playful one.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I went straight to the bar, he was smoking at the front door, standing almost
                                        naked,
                                        waiting for me.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The cold wind of the New York fall was carrying a noisy sound, a voice, her
                                        voice. I
                                        could hear the evil hairdresser’s lectures, while I couldn't avoid looking at
                                        him,
                                        wearing only a diaper, dressed as a baby, a hot ripped Eminem baby.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        He started rapping my song in the middle of the street, I ran to him, jumped on
                                        him
                                        and gave him the scariest kiss.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Definitely not thinking tonight on financial support or yet preparing myself for
                                        a
                                        life of boredom.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We drove away as fast as we could, snuck in his house to do it in his bed.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Immediately, he got rid of my dress and his diaper, although I kept my tutu.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        How could I not? It was so pretty, I've never had a chance to wear one nor never
                                        taken classical dance lessons.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The only other part of my costume that also didn't abandon me, despite the wild
                                        sex,
                                        was the perfectly constructed tower of hair on top of my head. It held steady,
                                        not
                                        even one thread of hair moved or any metal clip went missing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        By the time of the third orgasm, something else went missing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We couldn't find it anywhere.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “It might still be in there.”- The baby said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “No, It can't, I checked.” - Frankenstein's ex bride replied.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “My fingers are larger than yours...”- The baby suggested.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I was trying to make peace with the idea of him, scavenging through my vagina,
                                        when
                                        someone knocked at the door.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “Are you okay there?.” - His mom, who was also his flatmate said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        She kept offering her help for whatever was happening in his bedroom while her
                                        son's
                                        fingers were mining their way to the missing condom in my vagina.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “Got it.” - He yelled excitedly.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “Oh, wonderful sweetie, go to bed now, it's late.” - His mom congratulated him.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Having enough of the Halloween rap, I managed to get home.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There she was in her pj's, sitting outside, having a glass of chardonnay as
                                        breakfast, being financially supported, waiting for the fucking cats to come
                                        back.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This is how she called them. To be fair I wouldn’t blame her. She has never been
                                        a
                                        pet friendly person, although she warned him, he brought nine cats into the
                                        house
                                        and on top of that, he was never at home.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As I said, she was a bit evil, but not completely, at least she was still taking
                                        care of them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I sat next to her:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Trick or treat? - I asked, while showing her the two MDMA pills in my hand.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A moment of silence between us.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “Awww__fuck it.”- the awesome hairdresser, replied.
                                    </p>

                        was her first film school and the closest she could be to movies at that time. She read that

                        worked in
                        a video rental store too. Just saying.
